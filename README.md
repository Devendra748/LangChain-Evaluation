# LangChain: Evaluation
This repository contains code for evaluating the LangChain model using various methods. The evaluation process includes example generation, manual evaluation, and LLM-assisted evaluation.

# Example Generation
The example generation step involves creating test datapoints to evaluate the LangChain model. The repository provides both hard-coded examples and LLM-generated examples. The hard-coded examples are manually defined in the code, while the LLM-generated examples are generated using a language model.

# Manual Evaluation (and Debugging)
The manual evaluation step allows for testing and debugging the LangChain model manually. It provides a detailed log of the execution process, including input and output information at each step of the evaluation chain. Debugging mode can be enabled to facilitate troubleshooting and identifying issues.

# LLM-assisted Evaluation
LLM-assisted evaluation utilizes a language model (LLM) to assist in evaluating the LangChain model. It involves running the LangChain model with LLM-generated prompts and analyzing the output. This step provides insights into the performance and capabilities of the LangChain model.

# Usage
Set up the environment by loading the necessary dependencies and environment variables from the .env file.
Create the QandA application by initializing the RetrievalQA chain and setting up the necessary components such as document loaders, vector stores, and chat models.
Generate test datapoints by selecting examples from the dataset or using LLM-generated examples.
Combine the test examples and run them through the LangChain model using the qa.run() method.
Perform manual evaluation and debugging by enabling the debug mode and examining the log output.
Conduct LLM-assisted evaluation by utilizing the LLM to generate prompts and analyze the LangChain model's responses.
Please refer to the code documentation and comments for further details on each step and its implementation.
